This extension randomly permutes all text on the current page, preserving some semblance of sense.
First and last letters are preserved.
Words are permuted in a deterministic fashion: same word will produce same output inside one run.

Only works with Latin and Cyrillic alphabets for now.

(Note: this is a joke extension and the text above is garbled intentionally; also, it doesn't work on Web Store pages)
